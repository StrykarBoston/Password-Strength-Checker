# Password-Strength-Checker


# **Overview:**
- This Python tool checks the strength of passwords. <br>
- It offers an easy-to-understand method of determining how secure your passwords are by calculating a password's strength depending on its length and complexity.<br>


# **Features:**
- Determines the strength of a password by its length and complexity.<br>
- offers a user-friendly interface that is easy to use for entering and checking passwords.<br>
- shows a progress meter and a strength level (Weak, Medium, Strong) to help visualize the security of the password.<br>


# **Usage:**
- Clone or download this repository to your local machine.<br>
- Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` (if you're using a virtual environment, make sure to activate it first).<br>
- Run the script by executing python `password_strength_checker.py` (or the name of your Python script).<br>
- Enter a password in the input field and click the `"Evaluate Password"` button.<br>
- The tool will display the password strength rating and a progress bar indicating the password's security.<br>

# **How It Operates:**
- The password strength checker determines a password's strength based on its length and complexity using a straightforward method.<br>
- The following criteria are checked by the algorithm:<br>

# **Length:**
- Passwords shorter than 10 characters are considered weak, while those between 10 and 14 characters are considered medium strength. Passwords 14 characters or longer are considered strong.<br>
- Complexity: The tool checks for a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.<br>
